## How to develop
It is better to add `./node_modules/.bin` to your `PATH` to shorten command execution.
I use grunt to setup livereload and provide `connect` module to serve the page.
Run `npm install` to resolve all tools needed. 
I still failed to make karma test working due to my lack of knowledge regarding unit test of promise on angular.

To develop with livereload, run `grunt` to start the `connect` server on [localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009) and 
install `livereload` [addons/ extension](http://livereload.com/extensions/) for your favourite browser. 
Don't forget to push the livereload button (usually located on right top and it mimick refresh button) on your browser to be notified by `grunt watch` whenever there is file changed on `app` folder.
Start edit your files under `app` folder and browser should be refreshed automatically.

To run functional test:

- `webdriver-manager start` (on another console).

- `npm test` to start the [intern](https://theintern.github.io/intern/#what-is-intern)-runner.
